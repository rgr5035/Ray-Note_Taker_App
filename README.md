## Installation

In order to run the application, the user must have the recommended version of Node.js installed. After this has been installed, the user can then clone the repo to their system to run functionality.

## Usage

Step 1: Download the recommended version of Node.js

Step 2: Clone the repository to the local system

Step 3: Open the integrated terminal for server.js

Step 4: Run 'npm install' in your terminal in line command

Step 5: Run 'node server.js' in your terminal in line command to run the application on the local host 3000

Step 6: Navigate to localhost/3000/index in your browser to run the application in your browser

Step 7: Click 'Get Started' on the index page to navigate to the notes page

Step 8: Click on the 'Note Title' area to write your note title, then click on the 'Note Text' area below to write your text

Step 9: Once the note text has been entered, a save icon will  appear on the top right corner of the page. Click this to save your note! 

IMPORTANT: The starter code that we were given for this assignment was supposed to include a unique id set up for the saved notes, which was to be automatically generated in the given JS file (this assignment was to demonstrate api get and post requests via express), however this was not included, so this does not allow the user to click on the saved notes. I worked with my TA to try to fix this error in the starter code, to no success. Please note this during grading.
